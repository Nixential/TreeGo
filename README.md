# Go Tree Command

This project implements a basic version of the `tree` command in Go, which displays the directory structure of a given path in a tree-like format.

## Features

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Recursive directory traversal
- Visual representation of the directory structure

## Usage

To run the tree command, execute the binary with the desired directory path:

```bash
./tree [directory-path]
```

If no path is provided, it defaults to the current directory.

## Building from Source

To build the project from source, clone the repository and use `go build`:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
go build
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.
